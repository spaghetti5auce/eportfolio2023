  <p><span>Catsu Martzu al Dente: a Mac-and cheese recipe simply to die for!</span></p>
<p><img src="/users/4000/files/925568/preview?verifier=bdvE8217Qcdryt91YMGokO1tBsbdh6t1G4aUxjDN" alt="maggot mac.png"><br><br></p>
<p><span> </span><span>Born from the depths of my tortured psyche, Cazu Martzu al Dente is the title I have given to my ultimate Mac-and-Cheese recipe, a dish so delectable it has changed people’s lives forever and was featured in the most recent issue of </span><i><span>Mac-and-Cheese Monthly. </span></i><span>The delectable zestiness of the overly fermented cheese combined with the mouth-watering crunch from the maggots makes for a total flavor explosion. And for all you health nuts, the naturally growing maggots inside give extra vitamins and proteins you could never find in a regular mac-and-cheese. This ain't your momma’s cooking, unless your mom is a witch.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>My history with Mac-and cheese</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>Like many of you, Mac-and-cheese was a staple of my childhood. The simple yet satisfying pasta dish was something my underdeveloped brain always looked forward to. Those slow nights in the crack shack where mother was too “tired” to cook, so she would pop some velveeta in the microwave are memories I look back on fondly. That creamy goodness melting in my mouth made my taste buds weep with delight, helping to drown out the noises from mother and father wrestling in the bedroom after stabbing needles into each other. Once I was grown and moved into my very own crack shack, I knew I had to concoct my own mac-and-cheese. It would be the only way to replicate that nostalgic feeling as well as give closure to my parents' overdose.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A Blessing in Disguise</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>I had attempted many different versions of this recipe, staying up at ungodly hours of the night coming up with new ways to make this recipe special. I tried different cheeses, different pastas, additives like milk and honey, but they all failed to capture that same ecstasy I was looking for. It was missing something. Due to my many failed attempts, I was left with a lot of unfinished bowls of my failed attempts, leading to too many leftovers to finish in a reasonable time frame. I could not finish every bowl before it went bad, leading to many of the ones that couldn’t fit in the fridge to grow mold and rot. But this unfortunate waste of food would be a blessing in disguise, as I would finally find inspiration as I choked down one of the moldy bowls of mac (waste not, want not, amiright?) As I bit into the fuzzy macaroni and the fumes of fermenting cheese consumed my nostrils, I felt an unfamiliar crunch grit against my teeth. At first, I thought it might be the stale pasta shells, but this crunch was different. It was softer, gummier, and…squirmy? I looked down into my bowl and soon found my secret ingredient, maggots.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Cazu Martzu, The Maggot Cheese</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>After a bit of research, I soon found out that maggots and cheese actually have a bit of history to it. In Sardinia and certain regions of southern France, a special type of cheese is made that is almost impossible to get your hands on. Casu Martzu, literally translating to rotten or putrid cheese, is a Sardinian sheep milk cheese that is fermented into a point of decomposition through the deliberate addition of maggots to the aging process. After the cheese is made and ready to ferment, the wheel is left outside with part of the rind removed. This allows the </span><i><span>Piophila casei, </span></i><span>aka the cheese fly, to lay its eggs inside the cheese. Once the eggs hatch, the cheese fly larvae begin to eat through the cheese. The acid from the larvae’s digestive system breaks down the fats of the cheese, giving it a very soft and creamy texture.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>By the time the cheese is ready, the wheel will be infested with thousands of cheese fly larvae. Local Sardinians happily consume the maggots, even having a tradition to hold their hands above recently spread casu martzu to prevent the larvae from jumping out. For cowards that do not wish to dine on insect larvae, the cheese is put into a sealed bag, starving the maggots for oxygen. You will know the maggots are dead once the noises from the bag stop (much like popcorn!)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Despite being a local delicacy, The European Union has outlawed the cheese from being sold commercially, due to it being a “health concern” (the maggots can survive in your stomach and give you pseudomyiasis.) The cheese is also illegal in the U.S by extension.</span></p>
<p><span>Acquiring the secret ingredient</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>Once I had done all my research on Casu Martzu, I knew I had to get my hands on it. Unfortunately, it is illegal in both the U.S and Europe, so it wouldn’t be easy. After doing some digging, I found Casu Martzu to be prevalent on the black market, with plenty of shady options to choose from. I ultimately decided it would be best to go straight to the source, so I booked a flight to Sardinia, where I would meet my local cheese dealer for the hookup. This was not my first foray into the black market, but it would be my first time outside of the States, so it took some time getting used to local customs. My dealer asked that I not go into detail in my blog post or “ti pentirai di essere nato,” so what matters is at the end of the day I secured my ingredients, but not before trying some genuine Italian food. Yum!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The Final Trial</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>Once I was back in the great United States of America, I immediately got to work on implementing the Casu Martzu. While I had bought extra just in case, I still only had a limited supply with no easy way to get more (I had spent my life savings just to secure the previous deal) so I had to be extra diligent and really get it this time. Given how I wanted this to be perfect, I even opted to buy some fresh dough in Italy to make fresh pasta by hand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span> </span><span>I spent countless hours in the kitchen. Days turned into weeks as I made bowl after bowl of mac, rationing my Casu Martzu so that I would have enough for the final product. My pasta dough quickly ran dry, and I had to whip up some more using what ingredients I had. I spent many sleepless nights adjusting portions, heat, pan, egg, everything. The moment I stepped out of the kitchen is the moment I admit defeat. I could not let the mac and cheese best me. It must be perfect. Perfect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The Maggot(s) in Me</span></p>
<p><span>In order to perfect my ultimate dish, I had to have a full understanding of casu martzu, my casu martzu. Research wasn't enough, I had to go further. We had to become one. As I swallowed a piece of the wheel, I analyzed every bite I took, every second it slid down my throat, the time it spent breaking down in my stomach, everything. The cheese had been sitting out for quite some time, so extra maggots had hatched in the wheel. I felt every wiggle and squirm in my stomach, the way they wrapped around my teeth as I chewed the cheese in my mouth. I counted every single one I was aware of, even started to name them. They were now a part of me, and me a part of them. I am ready now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The Golden Path</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>The maggots inside guide me to the golden path. Everything was now crystal clear. The dough flowed seamlessly in my palms as each piece of pasta was meticulously shaped by hand into elbows (the only choice for mac-and-cheese, personally). Cooked to perfection, I could count every drop of milk (expired, of course)</span><span><br></span><span>As it bubbled on the pan. It was time. The last of the casu matzu was melted in, the maggots squirmed in the heat, desperately crawling as high as they could before becoming trapped in the melted cheese. It was done.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Rebirth</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>The finished dish was stored in only the finest bucket, and used my favorite bowl to serve myself a portion. The moment it entered my mouth, my entire world melted. The maggots inside wormed furiously in my stomach, grieving their dead kin. I could feel their pain, they would feel mine. I walked around my kitchen aimlessly, everything so bright and colorful. I watched my kitchen ceiling dance, celebrating the joy of life, its endless cycle of misery and bliss, one that can only keep you on the peak of greatness and total despair, for feeling in the middle would give no reason for life at all. Nothing will ever be the same again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>The Casu Martzu al Dente is a simple yet satisfying dish that anyone can make and enjoy! The patience of waiting for your ingredients to ferment is paid back in full by creamy, zesty goodness that just oozes in your mouth. The figurative cherry on top is the gooey, yet satisfying crunch from the maggot cheese. It is an absolute staple in my kitchen and it can be yours too!</span></p>
